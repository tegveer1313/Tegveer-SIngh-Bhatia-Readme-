Hey there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Tegveer, a engineer student, creative coder and self-proclaimed designer who specializes in front-end as well as back-end development. I make it my mission to translate user-focused designs into pixel-perfect websites or applications that run blazing fast.

I am also a 3D artist and a game developer creating 3d models and animation for games.
